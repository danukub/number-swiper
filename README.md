# NumberSwiper

This number swiper can be used to set an input value in a form.

**It also allows to set the initial value programmatically when a form is loaded**. To simulate the functionality the input field in the lower part of the view can be used to set a number and the submit button sets the value. The **setValue** method can be used for the programmatic usage.
